#TODO List for Oxnzbot Server Stub

1. The server mostly is behind a router, so it does not have a public Internet
IP address, so XMLRPCServer can not be setup so simple.
2. If the server pull the RPCRequest from the server, it maybe capable to
handle request.
3. If put XMPRPC server on the appengine, it is wiered to use google talk to
control that.
4. So the server just handle request, need not to setup the XMPRPC server.
5. Give up the XML RPC method.
6. Add a brain for the bot
